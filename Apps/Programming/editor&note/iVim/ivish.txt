==============================================================================
1. Concepts                                     *ios-exter-cmds-concepts*

To enhance some of its plugins and its whole editing workflow, iVim includes 
some external commands as the auxiliary tools.

How it works ~

An "external command" here means a complete program on its own. It does not
depend on the function of vim. Vim communicates with it only through the 
input and output.

For security's sake, iOS does not allow an app to launch a new program by 
itself. However, the project `ios_system` provides a brilliant workaround 
model to overcome this and make the program launching possible. Special thanks 
and cheers to `ios_system`!

Based on `ios_system`, iVim includes some external commands, and make them
look like coming from a shell. Therefore, you can use them like a shell
command, such as via |:!cmd|, |:write_c| or |:read!|.

Plugins ~

Since the external commands are integrated into iVim in the "standard" way
somehow, those plugins that didn't work or work properly due to the lack of
certain external command, may work or work better now.

For example, |netrw| can now edit remote files on a network computer via the
`scp://` protocol thanks to the availability of the command `scp`.

Some tech details ~

Normally, a program needs to become a process in the system to run. To prevent 
apps from launching new programs, iOS disables, from the bottom level, the 
ability of starting new processes. On the other hand, the project `ios_system` 
(https://github.com/holzschu/ios_system) makes it possible by changing to put
the program into a thread instead. Of course, the program needs to be modified
correspondingly somehow to fit this model.


==============================================================================
2. Available Commands                           *ios-exter-cmds-list*

The external commands that iVim provides, are useful command line tools that 
most users are familiar with and happy to have. Moreover, new commands could
be added and old ones could be removed in future updates. 

As a result, the inventory of available external commands are not given in 
details in this document.

However, as how it works for shell commands for vim on other platforms, you
can always use ^D (|c_CTRL-D|) after having input `:!` in the cmdline to list 
all available external commands in current version. Also, it lists external
commands that have the prefix you have input after `:!` in this way.


==============================================================================
3. Command Personalities                        *ios-exter-cmds-personalities*

Since the external commands have been modified somehow in order to run in the 
`ios_system` model, and iVim is not providing a genuine shell after all, they
may unavoidably have some particularities that users have to pay attention to.

However, for the reason of being subject to change in future updates, the 
details of external commands' personalities are not given in this document.
Instead, it is available in iVim's project wiki page |ios-exter-cmds-wiki|.

Environment variables ~
                                                *ios-exter-cmds-env*
As usual, one external command may respect certain environment variables. In
other words, the values of certain environment variables change the behavior
of the command. So this is a way to configurate the external commands. You can
also find related information on the wiki page |ios-exter-cmds-wiki|.

External commands wiki page ~
                                                *ios-exter-cmds-wiki*
To provide updated information on external commands, iVim has a specific wiki
page: https://github.com/terrychou/iVim/wiki/External-Commands

There, you can find useful information about external commands, such as their 
usage, configuration, etc.


==============================================================================
4. CA Certificates                              *ios-exter-cmds-ca-certs*

If you communicate with HTTPS or other TLS(SSL)-using servers via an external
command, it may need a CA certificate to do the SSL verification. Otherwise,
the communication may fail.

The location of the CA certificate file is given by the environment varibale
`$SSL_CERT_FILE`. 

Because it is kind of private, iVim does not provide this file by default. 
Therefore, you may have to obtain and deploy it by yourself. If you do not 
have clues on how to do this, there is a wiki page giving related suggestion 
and instructions:
https://github.com/terrychou/iVim/wiki/External-Command:-curl#ca-certificate


==============================================================================
5. Input & Output                               *ios-exter-cmds-io*

Editing ~

iVim provides an interactive line mode for running external commands. Which 
means that it waits and accepts your input if the command expects so. 

During the input:

a) it collects and reflects what you have input so far. 

b) you can delete the character before the cursor one by one, but cannot jump 
among them with the arrow keys. 

c) you confirm your input by inputting a return (new line). When that happens, 
iVim sends the content collected so far as a whole line to the command.

Control inputs ~

While the external command is running, iVim only accepts two control inputs:

1) `Ctrl-C`
it interrupts the running command. Different commands respond in their 
different respective ways to this input.

2) `Ctrl-D`
it means the end of the whole input. The command responds in the way when it 
gets EOF (End Of File).

Command output ~

iVim gets all the content that the command outputs to the standard output or 
the standard error, and prints it in the message window. Note that you cannot
scroll back when the output is more than one screen.


==============================================================================
6. Terminal                                     *ios-exter-cmds-term*

iVim enables the |+terminal| feature. Which means you can also run external
commands in a |terminal-window|.

The easiest way to run an external command in a terminal window, is to invoke
it via the |:terminal| command: >
        :terminal pwd               "open a terminal window and show current
                                    "directory in it
<
The advantages of running commands in a terminal window include:

a) colors 
the terminal window support the ANSI colors. Commands' output including them
will be displayed correctly. Note that iVim also enables |+termguicolors|, so
you can set the default 16 ANSI colors used by the terminal via the variable
|g:terminal_ansi_colors|.

b) multiple commands simultaneously
unlike running via ex command line, you can open multiple terminal windows
and run one command in each, at the same time.

c) more convenient output browsing
While you cannot scroll back to see the earlier output if it exceeds one page
in the ex command line, a terminal window, by default, will be kept open after
its command is finished. As a result, you are able to browse the whole output 
as easily as reading a normal document in vim.

d) auto-restore support
if a command was still running in a terminal window when iVim terminated, the
related window will be restored automatically at the next launch, with the 
right command started within it.

See |terminal| for details about the terminal window.

            
==============================================================================
7. ivish                                        *ivish*

To make running external commands in a more continous way, iVim includes a 
simple shell named `ivish`. You can launch it via: >
        :terminal ivish
<
or just simply: >
        :terminal
<
the difference between them is that in the latter case, the terminal window 
will be closed automatically when `ivish` exits.

Input & output ~

After `ivish` started, it shows a prompt `$ ` and waits for you to offer a 
command. `ivish` won't handle your input until you confirm by pressing enter.
After it started, the running command takes over the input and output. Only 
when it is done, `ivish` comes out again and expects your next command.

Line editing ~
                                                    *ivish-editing*
`ivish` provides a powerful line editing mode for you to edit your input.

`^A`: jump to the start of the line;
`^B`: move one character backward;
`^C`: cancel the current line and start a new prompt;
`^D`: delete the character under the cursor; act like enter if cursor at the
end; Note that if the current line is empty, it exits `ivish`;
`^E`: jump to the end of the line;
`^F`: move one character forward;
`^K`: delete all since the cursor;
`^T`: move one word backward;
`^U`: delete all before the cursor;
`^W`: delete one previous word; Note that since the terminal window eats `^W`
use `^W.` to do this;
`^Y`: move one word forward.

Hints & completion ~
                                                    *ivish-completion*
Right now, `ivish` provides completion for the following types:

a) command names
b) file or directory names

During your input, `ivish` watches the cursor position and gives the first of
all possible completion candidates as a hint. 

When you press the `tab` key:

a) if there are more than one completion candidates available, `ivish` lists 
them and complete the word to their longest common prefix;
b) if there is only one candidate, the whole word gets completed;
c) if no candidates available, nothing happens.

Note that hints and completion only work in `ivish` right now, not the running
commands.

History ~
                                                    *ivish-history*
Every confirmed line in `ivish` will be recorded as one history item. You can
navigate the list via:

`^P` or `up-arrow`: move to the previous line if available;
`^N` or `down-arrow`: move to the next line if available, otherwise return to
the current input;
`esc`: restore to the current input.

You can list the current history items via the internal command `history`.

There are some notes worth mentioning:

a) repeated lines are allowed;
b) at most 100 items are kept in the history;
c) if the env variable `IVISH_HISTORY_FILE` exists, `ivish` loads lines from
it everytime it starts, and saves history into it everytime it terminates;
d) running commands in `ivish` share one history, and it's not saving to a
file.

Internal commands ~
                                                    *ivish-internal-cmds*
`ivish` also provides some internal commands:

`exit`: terminate the current `ivish`;
`help`: show this documentation;
`history`: list the current history.
